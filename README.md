README: McDonald's Consumer Segmentation & Targeting
Overview
This project performs market segmentation for McDonald's consumers based on survey data. Using clustering techniques, we identify distinct consumer groups and evaluate them for targeted marketing strategies.

Steps Implemented
1. Data Preprocessing
Loaded dataset from Google Drive.
Selected key features related to consumer preferences.
Standardized the data using StandardScaler for better clustering performance.
2. Consumer Segmentation
K-Means Clustering: Applied with 3 clusters (determined via the elbow method).
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM): Used for probabilistic segmentation.
Cluster Evaluation Metrics:
Silhouette Score
Davies-Bouldin Index
3. Stability Analysis
Global Stability Analysis: Runs multiple clustering attempts to check consistency.
Segment-Level Stability Analysis: Compares K-Means and GMM assignments to validate segmentation.
4. Selecting the Target Segment
Analyzed cluster characteristics.
Identified the best segment based on the highest "Like" score.
Visualized segment differences using heatmaps.
5. Customizing the Marketing Mix
Analyzed consumer preferences in Price, Product, Place, and Promotion.
Provided marketing strategy recommendations for the most promising segment.
Key Insights
Consumer Preferences: Identified groups with varying preferences for taste, affordability, and health.
Target Segment: Selected based on engagement (Like score).
Marketing Strategy: Tailored product offerings, pricing, placement, and promotional efforts based on segment preferences.
